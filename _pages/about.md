Hi.....:star_struck: :star_struck: :star_struck:, I'm Mallikarjuna! People who likes me calling me as Arjun. Firstly a Huge Thanks from my 
side by spending your time to visit my page. If you are here, you are probably curious to know more about me. 

I'm a Senior Computer Science Undergradaute Student at R.V.R & J.C College of Engineering. I have major interests in Machine Learning,
Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Privacy-Preserving AI, and Psychology. I have minor interests in Economics, Social Enterprise, Health Care, and Psychology. I am always curious in reading research papers in these areas and apply those methodologoes to solve the toughest problems.

Apart from my studies I am interested in swimming, hiking and travelling.
