### 1.Image Captioning

It was one of the projects in the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program which
predicts the captions for a given image. I had implemented this project using a
combination of CNN and RNN architecture in my model.

Written in: Python &nbsp;

Libraries used: PyTorch &nbsp;

### 2. Facial Keypoint Detection
It was a project in the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Program which detects
facial key points in an image containing faces. I had an image processing library for
processing images and a Machine Learning library for creating a Convolutional Neural
Network. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/MALLI7622/Udacity-CVND-Projects/tree/master/Facial%20Keypoints%20Detection) &nbsp;

Written in: Python &nbsp;

Libraries used: OpenCV, PyTorch &nbsp;


### 3. Supervised Learning approach to Detect Anomalies in Blockchain using Federated Learning.
I was inspired by Research article Chained Anomaly Detection Models for Federated
Learning: An Intrusion Detection Case Study. I started working on this project on my
own. A secure and Private AI course on Udacity will help to do this by Federated
Learning. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/MALLI7622/Federated-Blockchain-Anamoly-Detection) &nbsp;

Written in: Python &nbsp;

Libraries used: PyTorch, [PySyft](https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft) &nbsp;

### 4. Fake News Detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning
I was inspired by Research Paper “Liar, Liar Pants on Fire”: A New Benchmark
Dataset for Fake News Detection. [Link to GitHub](https://github.com/MALLI7622/Fake-News-Detection) &nbsp;

Written in: Python &nbsp;

Libraries used: Scikit-Learn &nbsp;

### Finding Lanes in a Road using OpenCV

I had applied basic computer vision techniques to find lanes in Road.
